# Robust Error Handling and Fault Tolerance Strategies


## Understanding Error Handling in .NET


### Introduction to Error Handling in .NET


### Exception Hierarchy in .NET

System Exceptions: Cover exceptions thrown by the CLR (Common Language Runtime) that are generally indicative of a bug or unforeseen error in the application, like NullReferenceException, IndexOutOfRangeException, etc.
Application Exceptions: Discuss exceptions that should be thrown by user code to represent errors that can be anticipated and handled gracefully, such as InvalidOperationException when a method call is invalid for the object's current state.
Network-Specific Exceptions: Highlight exceptions specific to network operations, like System.Net.Sockets.SocketException and System.IO.IOException, explaining the scenarios in which they might be thrown (e.g., network timeouts, connection failures).
