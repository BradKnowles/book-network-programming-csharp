# Dedication

>To Tracy, my steadfast partner and the light of my life, whose support and love make everything possible. And to our children, Spencer, Nolan, and Mallory, who inspire me daily with their curiosity, joy, and boundless energy. While technical, this book is imbued with the motivation and strength you give me. May you always know how deeply you influence my world and the work I create.
>
>Thank you for being my anchor and my sail, making this journey not only possible but immensely rewarding.
>
>With all my love and gratitude.
